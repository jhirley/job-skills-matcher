# Job Skills Matcher Streamlit App

## Overview
The Job Skills Matcher is a Streamlit-based application that leverages Together.aiâ€™s language model to assist job seekers in tailoring their resumes for specific job descriptions. The app extracts essential hard skills from a given job description, matches them to a provided resume template, and outputs an updated, optimized resume.

## Features
- **Extract Key Skills**: Automatically identify the most important hard skills from a job description.
- **Skill Table Generation**: Display the extracted skills in a formatted table with 2-3 columns.
- **Resume Optimization**: Match extracted skills to relevant resume bullet points and update the resume template.
- **Validation and Grading**: Ensure the updated resume is grounded in the job description and consistent with the original resume template.

## Business Value
- Streamlines the process of tailoring resumes to job descriptions.
- Enhances job seekers' chances of landing interviews by focusing on relevant hard skills.
- Saves time by automating resume customization.
